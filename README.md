# lyuye.github.io (https://lyuye.github.io)

This is my personal website built with React and deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Development

To run the development server locally:
```
npm start
```

## Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages:
```
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and push it to the master branch of the GitHub repository.
